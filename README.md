### Application overview

``Simple diagram to show how application layers work``

### Architecture


##### Starting with Web Layer

    Browser is acting as a client in our architecture, it renders the web page for 
    the user who can also send requests to our application.
    
    Incoming requests are filtered with Spring Security filters which delegates them 
    to appropriate endpoints based on user authentication and authorization.

    After arriving requests are processed inside or delegated to the injected Services.
    Then Controllers update the view or redirect request to the other endpoints.

<br>

##### Business Logic Layer

    Application contains few Services which process the data in appropriate way or 
    delegate work to the other injected components and repositories. Services can also 
    create instances and manipulate entities if it's required.
<br>

#### Data Access Layer

    This layer handle communication between app and database. It supports basic CRUD 
    operations. Datasource beans which handle integration between web app and 
    MySQL Database has been created and configured in app Configuration. I also
    used connection pooling pattern with c3p0 framework to reuse existing database 
    connection and make overall performance better.
